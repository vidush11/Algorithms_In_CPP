<h1>This repository contains some of the data structures coded by me.</h1>
<i>
It also contains two of my best writings upto far in cpp by the name of Points and BarnesHut which contain the cpp optimised code for N line segment intersection and N body interaction respectively.
</i>
All the code is in main.cpp in every folder with additonal text files for test cases if you want.
